My first rpg 2D game in Java using Libgdx: libgdx.badlogicgames.com

Assets from Mr. Awesome Reiner Prokein: http://www.reinerstilesets.de/.

I did not finish this because I wanted to learn 3D, so I stopped creating 
this and started Epiphany3D.

Just updated to have a working jar and apk for testing, will never update
as this is only a prototype.
