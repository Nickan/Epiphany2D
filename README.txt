My first rpg 2D game in Java using Libgdx: libgdx.badlogicgames.com

Assets from Mr. Awesome Reiner Prokein: http://www.reinerstilesets.de/.

I did not finish this because I wanted to learn 3D, so I stopped creating this and started Epiphany3D.

I know full well that my coding skills and knowledge when I was creating this, six months ago was aweful, 
well I think up until now. I will try my best to update this, but I am currently rewriting the tower
defense I created in C++.
