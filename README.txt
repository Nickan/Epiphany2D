My first rpg 2D game in Java using Libgdx: libgdx.badlogicgames.com

Assets from Mr. Awesome Reiner Prokein: http://www.reinerstilesets.de/.

I did not finish this because I wanted to learn 3D, so I stopped creating 
this and started Epiphany3D.

Runnable jar is in Epiphany-desktop/bin, the apk is in Epiphany-android/bin.
